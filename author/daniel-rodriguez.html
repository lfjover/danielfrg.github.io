      <p><a href="http://https://storm.incubator.apache.org/">Apache storm</a> is a new technology
that allows to do real-time computation that its been in the big data news
lately and I was curious to try it to see if its really good or is a just
the new map-reduce.</p>
<p>One of the first (and no brainer) ideas I had was to do real-time
classification of a scikit-learn model, the main issue was that storm is Java and
I didn't want to all the integration between Java and Python
but after I saw in the pydata videos that the people at
<a href="https://parsely.com/">Parsely</a> already took some of that pain out with
their new <a href="https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse">streamparse</a> library
I had no more excuses to try it.</p>
<h2>Storm cluster</h2>
<p>I decided to deploy a storm cluster and after failing to use their EC2 scripts
I decided to do it myself using <a href="http://saltstack.com">salt</a>.

      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> How many times have you needed to create a powerful EC2 instance with the the python scientific stack
installed and the ipython notebook running? I have to do this at least 2 or 3 times every week.</p>
<p>A simple solution is to have an AMI with all the libraries ready and create a new instance every time,
you can even have the ipython notebook as an upstart service in ubuntu so it runs when the instance is ready.
That was my previous solution, but that was before I learned <a href="http://saltstack.com/">salt</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with the AMI solution is that it gets dated really quickly and while update it is not hard, it is
annoying. Also having to login into AWS, look for the AMI and spin up and instance is annoying.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> <a href="http://saltstack.com/">Salt</a> + <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a> + <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a></p>

      <p>A few weeks/months ago I found on HackerNews that Harvard was publishing all their <a href="http://cs109.org/">Data Science course content</a> (lectures, videos, labs, homeworks) online. I couldn't miss the opportunity to find what are they teaching, it was a nice experience to see how much I have learned and what else I am missing. Also, when I saw that everything was on python I knew they are doing it right!</p>
<p>The homeworks are IPython notebooks, the books are what I consider every Data Scientist should read: <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do">Python for Data Analysis</a>, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018483.do">Machine Learning for Hackers</a>, <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/master/Prologue/Prologue.ipynb">Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian methods for Hackers</a>.</p>
<p>The homeworks were amazing and useful, I haven't seen all the videos (yet) but the ones I did were amazing. Below I do a little review of each homework, the stuff I learned and stuff that I think should be different.</p>

      <p>I've been busy with real work to write any specific posts for the blog but I realize it was
a productive month. I worked a lot and learned quite a few things and  new technologies and
I have some thoughts about them, I usually use twitter to share simple thoughts but they usually get
lost on the noise.</p>
<p>So I am going to start a monthly series in which I discuss a little bit about what I have done that month.
Hopefully mixing with regular posts I am hoping that this makes me learn more and more stuff every month so I have something to write about. On this case is October and a few weeks of September.</p>

The company I am currently working on does something similar and I was quite amazed by the performance

and read the training vectors into numpy arrays, you can check it out on

<p>At the same time I found out about <a href="http://yhathq.com/">yhat</a>, I found about them
via twitter and after reading their blog I had to try their product. What they do is very simple
but very useful: take some python (scikit-learn) or R classifier and create a REST

very responsive and they helped me to solve some of my issues.</p>

downloading pelican and creating a theme based on my old Jekyll site.</p>
<p>The switch was easy just needed move some files, change some of the tags from liquid to
<a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/">jinja2</a> and add some metadata. The fact of having
less than 10 posts also helped because I did that part manually.</p>
