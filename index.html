        <p>It seems that I spend most time redesigning/developing this blog than actually blogging xD, just a few weeks ago I wrote about how I was blogging using jekyll with iPython notebooks and now I am talking about doing the same different static blog engine. The fact is that a few days ago I found pelican, the first serious python alternative to Jekyll I have found, and after reading 15 minutes about it I was downloading pelican and creating a theme based on my old Jekyll site. The switch was easy just needed move some files, change some of the tags from liquid to jinja2 and add some metadata. The ...</p>

        <p>Today I start working on the first assignment for the Coursera's Data Analysis course and I needed to make some basic transformation on the data so decide to include them on copper. I realize I was making some wrong decisions on the Type metadata on the Dataset. Since the money type is just a number (similar to a percent number on the case of this example) it is not necessary to have it as a different type, just make the transformations I was doing so I decide to remove the Money type, now the only types are Number and Category. Lets dive into the example: dataset: loansData.csv Import copper ...</p>

        <p>After being procrastinating for weeks the learning of D3.js and backbone.js I have finally made my first example using both libraries to explore (via histograms) a pandas DataFrame. The reason of the procrastination is very simple: I love python to much, because is probably the only language who is great in all areas (that I am interested at least): Great web frameworks as Django and Tornado - "fighting" with ruby (rails) Great Data Analysis packages such as pandas - "fighting" with R Great machine-learning libraries such as scikit-learn Probably not the most successful but has a good gaming ...</p>

        <p>I am taking the Data Analysis class on coursera, I wanted to keep learning R since I previously took Computing for Data Analysis but since that I change it to python. I think I love python too much so I did this week quiz on python using pandas and numpy. Not sure if I will do this each week/quiz of the class, we will see. You can find the questions and solutions for the quiz2.pdf, the data: ss06hid.csv, ss06pid.csv and the metadata on the github page.

        <p>Recently I restart my blog by moving from wordpress.com to github pages the reason is than about two weeks ago I found a blog on a github page using octopress (jekyll) and after reading 20 minutes I immediately wanted to use it and decide to switch. Wordpress is a good piece of software but wordpress.com is not, my complaints are. Is not fast enough Can't have custom analytics and the wordpress analytics sucks. Can't modify HTML or even CSS Don't have markdown support Jekyll has all of that and nd github pages for hosting is just magnificent. Publish a new post with git is how a hacker should ...</p>

        <p>This week on my Advance Business Intelligence class we took a look at Boosting and Bagging, two concepts well known by everybody in the machine learning world. The example on the class was take a simple Decision Tree and compare it to some bagged Decision Tree; FYI the example on class failed: SAS told that a simple DT was "better" than the bagged one, some error on SAS Enterprise Miner that we could not found. Time to see if python is capable of doing it. This first part is just a recap of Post #1 I am using the same donors.csv that I am using for my class. We import the data and set some ...</p>

        <p>I wanted to see really how fast and good is the API for the package for that reason I decide to repeat the project #3 of my basic "Business Intelligence" class. That project took me at least 16 hours to complete, of course that includes the creation of the report but I remember to spend from 5 to 6 hours on SAS doing the data mining. The data is about the customers of a catalog, the objective is to predict which customers are more likely to respond to the catalog campaign and send a catalog to those customers. There is a dataset for training (2000 rows) and another one for testing (2000 ...</p>

        <p>As part of my Master in IT & Management this semester I am taking a class called "Advanced Business Intelligence" which is the same as machine learning or data analysis to the Business people; in general they teach how to use SAS (Enteprise Miner) to do data mining. SAS and Enterprise Miner is a good software - with some problems: Costs a lot of money Is slow as hell, seriously Good for business people, not so much for engineers Costs a lot of money I was able to get it for $100 dollars because the university has an arrangement with SAS but without that is impossible to buy for personal use. ...</p>
