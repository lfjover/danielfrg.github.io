# Creating a blog in 2012 « CTRL 68

Yes, I am creating a blog on October 4, 2012!

**Why?** Having a flu is one of the reasons. Other reason is that I and want to improve my English and have a lot of time to waste (not having a car on the US is hard). Also having a blog in 2012 is old-stylish and that is **always **cool.

**About me: **Originally from Colombia and currently living in Frisco, TX (DFW Area) pursuing a Master in Information Technology and Management on the University of Texas at Dallas.

Dog lover, book reader, TV Series Fanatic and amateur gamer. Passionate about new technologies, always wanting to learn something new (mainly about technology). Hopes to keep writing for a long time.
