has been living in the internet since then.
In high school and following the dream of making a Super Mario World clone he
started to program games in Flash at the same time he started to do some web
development/blogging and SEO using PHP and Wordpress, thank god he is over those days.</p>
<p>In college he could not decide between Computer or Electrical Engineering so he studied both.
After 2 years of boredom of computer science classes teaching stuff he already
knew he drop it and continued with Electrical Engineering which proposed a challenge and new knowledge.
After graduating from college he and a group of 23 students took part of the
NASA Lunabotics mining competition representing Universidad de los Andes.</p>
<p>Then he left his homeland and started a masters degree in
Information Technology and Management from the University of Texas at Dallas.

<p>In an attempt to record his learning (and fulfill his frustrated dream of becoming a blogger) he started this blog.</p>
<p>Hi is a dog lover, book reader, TV Series fanatic and amateur gamer.
Very passionate about new technologies and always wanting to learn something new.</p>
